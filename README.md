================

Medic is a musicical experience as defined by Mathew Austin Tuton.

The goal behind the site design was to redefine typical UI. Utilizing ThreeJS, UI is brought to an entirely new level with interactivity at the forefront.

Inspired by Ocean/Water, mainly the use of Fractals to build the "water element"

Built on top of HTML5 Boilerplate and then refactored as a NodeJS hybrid enviornment. The current site is congigured to run behind an apache server (and possibly a MysSQL database).

TODO: Configure server and site so that NodeJS serves all content. No Apache. If a database is used, then utilize MongoDB, most
likely using the MongoDB to JSON plugin.
